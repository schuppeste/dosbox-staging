# Supporting and Contributed Material

This directory holds material that may benefit the users, developers, or
project but that aren't directly part of the core source of the project
itself.

## Inventory

- **static-opus**: Compiles a static Opusfile library that can be used
by `./configure` in the absense of `pkg-config`

- **test-cases**: A directory of test-case sub-directories each holding
one or more batch files that exercise some functionality in DOSBox.
See the run-tests documentation for more detail `<repo-root>/scripts/run-tests.md`.
